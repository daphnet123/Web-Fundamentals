      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My goal is to share some of the different blankets I have crocheted myself as a beginner, as well as some clothes that I have bought over the years that I loved and wanted to share with others.</p>
      <p>One day, I would love to create a store for people to buy these things, but for the time being, come see the beautiful blankets and the cute clothes that I enjoy talking about!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This is a great site for those who are looking for handmade blankets, whether that's baby blankets, or a nice throw. Or, anyone who enjoys window shopping for cute and comfy clothes.</p>
      <p>I know that I am a huge window shopper. I love looking at clothes without the commitment of actually spending the money, so this is a great way to enjoy that hobby!</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>Health Benefits from “Window Shopping”</p>
      <p>“A 2014 study from the Journal of Consumer Psychology found that retail therapy not only makes people happier immediately, but it can also fight lingering sadness. 
          As Dr. Bea points out, just browsing, scrolling or window shopping (but not buying something) can positively impact your mood. It’s this simple anticipation of the eventual possibility of a reward or treat that releases dopamine — the hormone neurotransmitter in your brain that makes you feel good.
          Dopamine increases your desire to continue to seek out things that make you feel good (hence retail therapy being a favorite go-to!)
          “Some think the dopamine is released when you actually get a reward or purchase an item, but it begins before you make a purchase as you’re delighting in all the possibilities,” he says. “It’s about the whole journey.””

      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <p>
        Why will people come to your site?</p>
      <p>
        People will come to my site to get that dopamine hit of browsing cute clothes and beautiful handmade crochet items without the commitment of having to actually spend money.</p>

      <p>
        What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</p>
      <p>  
        My site is really just for those who are either searching for a place to browse for fun, or for those who are really crafty and want to find different clothes and crochet items as inspiration for a new project.</p>

      <p>  
        What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?</p>
      <p>  
        I really believe that anyone can enjoy my site without any previous knowledge of crochet or fashion. “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder” therefore, this website is full of things that I think are cute, but not everyone will agree. That is why the only thing I believe to be necessary when viewing my website is an open mind.</p>

      <p>  
        Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?</p>
      <p>  
        Since my website is a non-committal website, there is such a beauty in “window-shopping” that gives a visitor some relief. They get the enjoyment of viewing a variety of women’s clothing, and a variety of crocheted items without having to spend the money. Some may want the enjoyment of new ideas/inspiration for their own project(s), so this is a great and free way to get that.</p>

      <p>  
        Why did you want to create this specific kind of website?</p>
      <p>  
        I wanted to create this website to showcase some of my clothes and handmade crochet blankets and possibly other items for people to visually enjoy and to create an option for people to get ideas and inspiration from. I know there are a lot of people who are really creative, and many people in my generation are getting into traditional hobbies like sewing their own clothes or creating their own stuffed animals for themselves or others. Because of how much these have grown, I wanted to help others have free access to ideas I’ve created, or even where I may have bought certain supplies for my crafts. Since I, myself have wanted to get more into sewing my own clothes, and altering as wanted, I wanted to create a platform where I can be free to share these ideas and possibilities so others may feel supported if they decide to do the same.</p>

      <p>
        Overall</p>
      <p>  
        So, overall, not only is my website great for entertainment purposes, but it also will have health benefits for these site visitors too. It will also create some inspiration for others to feel open to endless possibilities to be the most creative they can be!</p>

      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        Setup is similar to the Dry Oar wireframe. 
        The header is similar, but there's only 3 pages to choose from. 
        The footer is similar, but I want to have Instagram, TikTik, and Facebook, most likely, as my socials for contact.
