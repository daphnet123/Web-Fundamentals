    <h2>My name is Daphne</h2>
    <p>I want to introduce myself as Daphne Gopinath, as I recently have gotten married and I'm still working on changing my last name. I currently live in the Rochester, Minnesota area. My husband and I moved from Tennessee, and got married in the Gilbert, Arizona temple because I grew up in Arizona. I was born in Kansas though, so of course I'm a Kansas City Chiefs fan, and lucky me, a Taylor Swift fan too. As you can tell, I've moved quite a bit in my life.</p>
    <p>I love to read, crochet, and cook, but I also LOVE Disney. Whether that's going to the parks or watching the movies, I'm all in. My husband and I actually Honeymooned in Orlando and went to the parks while we were there. I recently started crocheting blankets, and actually made a baby blanket for one of my friends. I'm still a beginner, but it's a fun hobby of mine.</p>
    <p>I'm currently pursuing an Associates Degree in Data Science as a lot of it is super interesting to me, and sometimes it just clicks in my brain better than a lot of other careers. Although I no longer live in Rexburg, I do miss the close proximity of most things. I miss being able to walk to Cafe Rio, or to a soda shop, or to the park. In fact, I'm pretty confident in saying my husband feels the same way. I'm really excited to learn how to build websites because I've always wanted to learn about it, and I've always had a very entrepreneurial mindset.<p>
    <p>I've been a member of the Church my whole life, and like I mentioned earlier, I got married in the Gilbert, Arizona temple in February of this year. I know we shouldn't have favorite temples, but hands down, it's my favorite temple. And it's really special to me that I did my first ever ordinance in that temple when I was just 12 years old, and 8.5 years later, I got married there.</p>
